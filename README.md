# AUKCAT-Data-Selection-Pipeline

AUKCAT-Data-Selection-Pipeline is an iterative data-selection procedure that filters high-confidence pseudo-instances from the CVAE-generated data pool and incrementally integrates them to expand the augmented dataset.

## Dependencies
1. pandas 1.4.2
2. numpy 1.24.3
3. sklearn 1.0.2
4. scipy 1.5.3

## Pipeline Inputs
The AUKCAT-Data-Selection-Pipeline uses the following inputs to iteratively select high-confidence pseudo instances and expand the augmented training dataset:
### 1. Original Dataset
The original dataset consists of substrate–EC number–species triples paired with experimentally measured kcat values. Substrates are embedded using [Mol2Vec](https://github.com/samoturk/mol2vec), EC numbers via [EC2Vec](https://github.com/MengLiu90/EC2Vec), and species via Node2Vec.

The file ```./Datasets/Original_data.csv``` contains all original instances used in the data selection pipeline. The file ```./Datasets/example_data.csv``` contains example data after embedding.

### 2.Pseudo Dataset Generated by AUKCAT-CVAE
The pseudo instances generated by the CVAE includes: 
(1) Matching features (mol2vec, ec2vec, species embedding)
(2) pseudo kcat: kcat value predicted by CVAE + kNN
(3) source_index: index of the original sample this pseudo instance was originated from
```./Datasets/Pseudo_data.csv``` contains example data generated by AUKCAT-CVAE.

### 3.CVAE Data Generation Script
A Python script invoked using ```subprocess.run()``` to dynamically generate fresh pseudo samples use the pre-trained AUKCAT-CVAE model in each round.
